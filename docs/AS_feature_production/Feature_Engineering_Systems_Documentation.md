## System 1: Revenue Proxy Feature Engineering

### Business Objective
Estimate the revenue contribution potential of each wallet for centralized exchange (CEX) business applications, enabling data-driven user segmentation and targeted service offerings.

### Mathematical Formula
```
REVENUE_SCORE_PROXY = 0.4 × AVG_TRANSFER_USD × TX_PER_MONTH + 
                      0.35 × (DEX_EVENTS + DEFI_EVENTS) × AVG_TRANSFER_USD + 
                      0.25 × BRIDGE_TOTAL_VOLUME_USD
```

## System 2: Activity Diversity Feature Engineering

### Business Objective
Quantify the diversity of wallet activity patterns across different blockchain event types using Shannon entropy, enabling behavioral segmentation and personalized engagement strategies.

### Mathematical Formula
Shannon entropy normalized to 0-1 scale:
```
H(X) = -Σ(i=1 to n) pi × log₂(pi)
ACTIVITY_DIVERSITY_SCORE = H(X) / log₂(n)

Where:
- pi = proportion of events of type i
- n = number of non-zero event types
- Score ranges from 0 (specialist) to 1 (generalist)
```

    focused: 0.4         # Focused activity (0.2-0.4)  
    moderate: 0.6        # Moderate diversity (0.4-0.6)
    diverse: 0.8         # High diversity (0.6-0.8)
