### Manual Analysis and Recommendations Report of Dashboard Based Off Model Configurations and Data

## Objective and Explanation of This File and its Purpose:

This file is put in place to show a manual analysis and interpetation of the results of the pipelines built in this github repository in a way that will model the type of interpretation possible with the use of this repository. 

Of course, this project is a minimum viable version of what is possible in use of this data and in terms of what could be built with further CEX data available and in the context of actually putting this concept into use. Therefore, the output of this data science and analytics project is only a small part of what could be built. The ability of the stakeholder using this repository to input new data and utilise new configurations to gain updated analytics of a range of blockchains leads way to the possibility of a self-serve analytics making use of the models built. A feedback-based UEX is another possibility, utilising AI and the impact of stakeholders' opinions to constantly improve the value to key decision making available. More on these concepts is talked about in TLADs documentation along with the README; the main thing to note here is that this analysis report of the "model run" is simply to show how this analytics can be interpreted and what is possible for future developments and use of this repository and if it were to be actually utilised.
